The idea I am thinking about is making the array a set, as Gemini taught me how that structure has constant lookups through a process called hashing. I am learning more by reading the Oracle documentation guide, but I am not sure if this will be all I have to do. I wonder how compareto can be replaced by AASCI values, and why that would cut the constant lookups. This felt like a good start for my redemption arc... |

I learned about how there are different types of sets (hashsets and tree sets), which have methods that are constant lookups for contain methods. |

To do that, I believe that I need to avoid collisions in words by using the fact that each digit has a different power of 10 value. Therefore, converting each character to aasci and multiplying by 10 can get me a unique value for each character. |
| September 29 |  3:00 - 3:45 pm  | This is going to go down as my most glorious 45 minutes of coding in my Menlo CS career. I came in fresh off of class knowing exactly how I wanted to execute the code, and I got it done with only minor debugging. I knew I needed to use a map, but the issue I had to grapple with was how to make each word distinct, and how to make an array big enough for all the words. For the first issue, I realized that each letter is in a "digit place", so I can multiply its aasci value by whatever power of 10 the letter lands on. This allowed me to differentiate every word, especially ones like "act" and "cat". However, the issue is that now my string array needs to hold an unreasonable amount of elements. To solve for that, I just modded all the values by a size greater than my array so that the size of my array is equal to that of the dictionary. Then I did the same for the text array and added any words that didn't appear in my map to an incorrect words arraylist. |
