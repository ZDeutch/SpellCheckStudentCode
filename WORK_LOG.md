| September 25 |  1:00 - 1:40 pm  | I spent this time writing the conventional code in bad runtime complexity to pass the tests and act as a baseline. The idea I am thinking about is making the array a set, as Gemini taught me how that structure has constant lookups through a process called hashing. I am learning more by reading the Oracle documentation guide, but I am not sure if this will be all I have to do. I wonder how compareto can be replaced by AASCI values, and why that would cut the constant lookups. This felt like a good start for my redemption arc... |

I learned about how there are different types of sets (hashsets and tree sets), which have methods that are constant lookups for contain methods. |

To do that, I believe that I need to avoid collisions in words by using the fact that each digit has a different power of 10 value. Therefore, converting each character to aasci and multiplying by 10 can get me a unique value for each character. |
