| September 25 | 1:00 - 1:40 pm | I spent this time writing the conventional code in bad runtime complexity to pass the tests and act as a baseline. The idea I am thinking about is making the array a set, as Gemini taught me how that structure has constant lookups through a process called hashing. I am learning more by reading the Oracle documentation guide, but I am not sure if this will be all I have to do. I wonder how compareto can be replaced by AASCI values, and why that would cut the constant lookups. This felt like a good start for my redemption arc... |
